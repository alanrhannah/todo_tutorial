# Allows tasks to be nested under one another
# Saves the task tree to a JSON file
# work with "sub commands" (i.e. call the script with different args to do different actions)

# `todo a` adds a task at top level
# `todo d 3.2` deletes the second sub task of the third list
# `todo t 3.2` toggles the second sub task of the third list (i.e. marks it done/not done)

# parsing command line args
# - parse commands 
# - parse level of each 
# write to json
# print task list to
